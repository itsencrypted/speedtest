Don't know how to use the format options? See

# Welcome to Etheachers!

We are a community of Ethereum teachers that got together to bring you the best of Ethereum development to you. Together (you and us), we will build functional and awesome applications to allow the Ethereum ecosystem to expand its usage.

Source: Here’s an example of a Museum. This image was uploaded from my computer.

And here’s a picture of a museum; but this one was picked on the interwebs.

And finally...don’t forget to visit: [https://itsencrypted.com](https://itsencrypted.com)

Here goes a listed table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Price</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Item 01</td>
    <td>AMZN</td>
    <td>Amazon Stock</td>
    <td>$3182.7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Item 02</td>
    <td>NVDA</td>
    <td>Nvidia Stock</td>
    <td>$531.07</td>
  </tr>
</table>


1. A set of items can also appear in this format:

    1. Format a

    2. Format b

    3. Format c

    4. Format d

    5. A numbered list can also do magic

2. A second number of items is appearing

3. And, last, but not the least.. The final item is number 3

A bulleted list is expressed as below:

* Items that need attention

* Items that need no urgent attention; but must be done

* Items that are not part of the main project

One more thing that can, or could happen is by giving websites, such as [https://ft.com](https://ft.com) as an example of articles about [the political madness going on in the world](https://www.ft.com/content/58cf578a-cc8d-4316-862a-9d55b6969fe4) which seems to be very out of control right now.

## More Examples

As we move on with our nonsense text, we have now reached a level of understanding of the markdown language.

To explain better, let’s highlight some of the text in yellow to see if this markdown language will actually convert the highlighted text.

It is important to mention that the more I write; the easier it will be.

import { useState } from 'react'

function Home() {

   return <div>

       <h1>Página Inicial</h1>

       <h2>Você está na branch de teste</h2>

       <div> Testando as ferramentas da Vercel enquanto isso...</div>

       <Contador />

       <div>Teste</div>

        </div>

}

function Contador(){

   const [contador, setContador] = useState(1);

   function adicionarContador(){

       setContador(contador + 1);

   }

   return(

       <div>

           <div>{contador}</div>

           <button onClick={adicionarContador}>Adicionar</button>

       </div>

   )

}

export default Home

This was a code snippet taken from VSCode

And here goes another code snippet; but this time from Android Studio; and further changed to CourierNew font:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class AboutUsScreen extends StatelessWidget {

 static const String *id *= '/aboutus';

 @override

 Widget build(BuildContext context) {

   return Container();

 }

}

Let’s see how this goes…

Thanks for staying here.
